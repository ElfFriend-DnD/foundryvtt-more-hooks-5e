# More Hooks D&D5e

Adds hooks to the 5e system. This is intended to be a library module for other modules (or Hook Macro users) to leverage.

Its goal is to eventually contribute these hooks directly to the core 5e system and disappear. The API is going to follow Semantic Versioning as it is likely to undergo sizable changes as the hooks are hammered out.
